# Extract, Transform, Load

## Overview

This module went through the extract, transform, load and data cleaning process
using movie data from Wikipedia and Kaggle, and viewer rating info from Movie Lens. 
Our work on this module was primarily done in Jupyter Notebook using Python and the 
Pandas library, and was then transferred into database form using PostgreSQL.
